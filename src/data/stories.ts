    title: 'The Origin of the New Year\'s Kiss',
    excerpt: 'Discover the romantic history behind the tradition of kissing at midnight on New Year\'s Eve.',
    content: 'The tradition of the New Year\'s kiss dates back to ancient Roman times during the festival of Saturnalia. Romans believed that the first person you encountered in the new year would set the tone for the months ahead. In medieval England, kissing under mistletoe was thought to bring good luck, and this tradition evolved into the midnight kiss we know today. The kiss is believed to purify from evil spirits and ensure that the year ahead will be filled with affection and connection.',

    title: 'Why We Make Resolutions',
    excerpt: 'The ancient practice of setting intentions for the new year has roots in Babylonian traditions.',
    content: 'The Babylonians are believed to be the first people to make New Year\'s resolutions about 4,000 years ago. However, their new year began in mid-March when crops were planted, not January. During a 12-day religious festival called Akitu, Babylonians would make promises to the gods to pay their debts and return borrowed objects. If they kept their word, the gods would bestow favor on them for the coming year. The Romans continued this tradition when Julius Caesar reformed the calendar and established January 1st as the beginning of the new year.',

    title: 'The Legend of Nian',
    excerpt: 'A Chinese folktale explains why red decorations and fireworks are central to New Year celebrations.',
    content: 'According to Chinese legend, there was a ferocious beast called Nian that would emerge from hiding on the eve of the new year to devour crops, livestock, and even villagers. One year, an old man appeared in the village and discovered that Nian feared three things: the color red, fire, and loud noises. The villagers began decorating their homes with red paper, burning bamboo to create loud cracking sounds, and lighting firecrackers. When Nian arrived, it was frightened away. This victory is now celebrated every year during Chinese New Year with red decorations, fireworks, and family gatherings.',

    title: 'January: Named After Janus',
    excerpt: 'The Roman god with two faces gave January its name and its connection to new beginnings.',
    content: 'January is named after Janus, the Roman god of beginnings, gates, transitions, time, duality, doorways, passages, and endings. Janus is depicted with two faces—one looking to the past and one to the future. This symbolism is particularly fitting for the first month of the year, as we reflect on the year gone by while looking forward to new possibilities. The Romans believed that Janus presided over the beginning and ending of conflict, and hence war and peace. Offerings to Janus were thought to bring successful beginnings and good fortune.',

    title: 'Auld Lang Syne: A Song of Friendship',
    excerpt: 'The story behind the world\'s most famous New Year\'s song written by Scottish poet Robert Burns.',
    content: 'Auld Lang Syne, meaning "times long past" or "old times," was written by Scottish poet Robert Burns in 1788. The song reflects on old friendships and times gone by, asking whether old friends should be forgotten or remembered with fondness. Burns claimed he transcribed it from an old man\'s singing, though he likely made additions to the original folk song. It became associated with New Year\'s Eve in the late 19th century and is now sung in countries around the world as the clock strikes midnight, serving as a bittersweet reflection on the passage of time and the importance of cherished relationships.',
