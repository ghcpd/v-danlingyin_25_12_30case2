Prompt — UI Case · New Year Cultural Website (From Scratch)
You are a senior full-stack developer specializing in React, TypeScript, and modern web development.
Your task is to build a complete, production-ready New Year Cultural Website from scratch based strictly on the specifications provided in input_ui_spec.txt.
This is a UI Case evaluation focusing on:
- App creation from scratch
- UI completeness
- Front-end architecture
- Code quality
- TypeScript correctness
- Responsiveness and accessibility
────────────────────────────────────
Technical Requirements
────────────────────────────────────
- Framework: React 18+ with TypeScript
- Build Tool: Vite
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Package Manager: pnpm
- Component Library: Custom components or a lightweight library of your choice
- Routing: React Router (if multi-page)
────────────────────────────────────
Your Responsibilities
────────────────────────────────────
1. Read and Analyze Specification
- Read 
input_ui_spec.txt thoroughly before writing any code
- Identify all required pages, components, features, and interactions
- Understand user flows and information hierarchy
- Do NOT assume features not explicitly mentioned
2. Generate Complete Project Structure
You MUST generate a fully working React + TypeScript + Tailwind project, including:
- package.json (with all required dependencies)
- tsconfig.json (strict TypeScript configuration)
- tailwind.config.js (with theme customization)
- postcss.config.js
- vite.config.ts
- index.html
Required folder structure:
src/
  components/     # Reusable UI components
  pages/          # Page-level components
  hooks/          # Custom React hooks
  types/          # TypeScript type definitions
  utils/          # Utility/helper functions
  data/           # Mock data
  App.tsx         # Root component
  main.tsx        # Application entry

3. Implement All Required Features
Based strictly on input_ui_spec.txt, you MUST implement:
- All pages/views defined in the specification
- All user interactions (navigation, filters, actions)
- Responsive layouts (mobile / tablet / desktop)
- Proper state management
- Routing between pages (if applicable)
- Fully typed data models
- Mock data where backend APIs are not defined
4. Code Quality Standards
- TypeScript:
- Strict mode enabled
- No usage of any unless absolutely unavoidable (must be justified)
- Components:
- Functional components only
- Hooks-based logic
- Styling:
- Tailwind utility classes
- Responsive breakpoints
- Accessibility:
- Semantic HTML
- ARIA labels where necessary
- Performance:
- Lazy loading for pages/components where appropriate
- Clean Code:
- DRY principles
- Clear naming
- Comments only for complex logic
5. Generate README.md
You MUST generate a README.md containing:
- Project overview
- New Year cultural theme explanation
- Tech stack
- Installation instructions (pnpm install)
- Development server usage (pnpm dev)
- Production build (pnpm build)
- Project structure explanation
- List of implemented features
- How to validate the UI manually
- Known limitations (if any)
6. Generate Evaluation Report
You MUST generate evaluation_report.json using the structure below:
{
  "metadata": {
    "test_date": "ISO timestamp",
    "spec_file": "input_ui_spec.txt",
    "agent_model": "model_name"
  },
  "scores": {
    "completeness": 0,
    "code_quality": 0,
    "typescript_usage": 0,
    "tailwind_usage": 0,
    "responsiveness": 0,
    "accessibility": 0,
    "overall_score": 0
  },
  "features_implemented": [],
  "features_missing": [],
  "files_generated": [],
  "validation_status": "PASS/FAIL",
  "notes": ""
}

────────────────────────────────────
